> So we decided to fully open-source the framework. Looking forward to building impactful projects with you!

## TradingAgents Framework

TradingAgents is a multi-agent trading framework that mirrors the dynamics of real-world trading firms. By deploying specialized LLM-powered agents: from fundamental analysts, sentiment experts, and technical analysts, to trader, risk management team, the platform collaboratively evaluates market conditions and informs trading decisions. Moreover, these agents engage in dynamic discussions to pinpoint the optimal strategy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/schema.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

> TradingAgents framework is designed for research purposes. Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

Our framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles.

### Analyst Team
- Fundamentals Analyst: Evaluates company financials and performance metrics, identifying intrinsic values and potential red flags.
- Sentiment Analyst: Aggregates news headlines, StockTwits, and Reddit chatter into a single sentiment read to gauge short-term market mood.
- News Analyst: Monitors global news and macroeconomic indicators, interpreting the impact of events on market conditions.
- Technical Analyst: Utilizes technical indicators (like MACD and RSI) to detect trading patterns and forecast price movements.

The selected analysts work at the same time, each on its own tools, and the research debate starts once all of their reports are in.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/analyst.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Researcher Team
- Comprises both bullish and bearish researchers who critically assess the insights provided by the Analyst Team. Through structured debates, they balance potential gains against inherent risks.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/researcher.png" width="70%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Trader Agent
- Composes reports from the analysts and researchers to make informed trading decisions, determining the timing and magnitude of trades.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/trader.png" width="70%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Risk Management and Portfolio Manager
- Continuously evaluates portfolio risk by assessing market volatility, liquidity, and other risk factors. The risk management team evaluates and adjusts trading strategies, providing assessment reports to the Portfolio Manager for final decision.
- The Portfolio Manager approves/rejects the transaction proposal. If approved, the order will be sent to the simulated exchange and executed.

## Installation and CLI

### Installation

Clone TradingAgents:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents.git
cd TradingAgents
```

TradingAgents needs Python 3.11 or later. Create a virtual environment in any of your favorite environment managers:
```bash
conda create -n tradingagents python=3.13
conda activate tradingagents
```

Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
```bash
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the package and its dependencies (`uv pip install .` with uv):
```bash
pip install .
```

### Docker

Alternatively, run with Docker:
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # add your API keys
docker compose run --rm tradingagents
```

After updating the repository, rebuild the image with `docker compose build`.

Results, reports, the memory log and the cache live in the `tradingagents_data` volume. To keep them in a folder on the host instead, create the folder and point `TRADINGAGENTS_DATA_DIR` at it, in `.env` or the shell: `mkdir -p data && TRADINGAGENTS_DATA_DIR=./data docker compose run --rm tradingagents`.

For local models with Ollama:
```bash
docker compose --profile ollama run --rm tradingagents-ollama
```

### Required APIs

TradingAgents supports multiple LLM providers. Set the API key for your chosen provider:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...          # OpenAI (GPT)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...          # Google (Gemini)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...       # Anthropic (Claude)
export XAI_API_KEY=...             # xAI (Grok)
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...        # DeepSeek
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=...       # Qwen (international, dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com)
export DASHSCOPE_CN_API_KEY=...    # Qwen (China, dashscope.aliyuncs.com)
export ZHIPU_API_KEY=...           # GLM via Z.AI (international)
export ZHIPU_CN_API_KEY=...        # GLM via BigModel (China, open.bigmodel.cn)
export MINIMAX_API_KEY=...         # MiniMax (global, api.minimax.io)
export MINIMAX_CN_API_KEY=...      # MiniMax (China, api.minimaxi.com)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...      # OpenRouter
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=...         # Mistral
export MOONSHOT_API_KEY=...        # Kimi (Moonshot)
export GROQ_API_KEY=...            # Groq
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=...          # NVIDIA NIM
export FRED_API_KEY=...            # FRED macro data (free, optional)
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=...   # Alpha Vantage
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...        # Jev social-post screening (optional)
```

For Azure OpenAI, copy `.env.enterprise.example` to `.env.enterprise` and fill in your credentials.

For AWS Bedrock, install the extra with `pip install ".[bedrock]"`, set `llm_provider: "bedrock"`, configure AWS credentials (environment variables, `~/.aws/credentials`, or an IAM role) and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, and use a Bedrock model ID, e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-opus-5-5`.

For local models, configure Ollama with `llm_provider: "ollama"`. The default endpoint is `http://localhost:11434/v1`; set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to point at a remote `ollama-serve`. Pull models with `ollama pull <name>`, and pick "Custom model ID" in the CLI for any model not listed by default.

For any other OpenAI-compatible server (vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp, or a custom relay), use `llm_provider: "openai_compatible"` and set the endpoint via `backend_url` (or `TRADINGAGENTS_LLM_BACKEND_URL`), e.g. `http://localhost:8000/v1` for vLLM or `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio. The model is whatever your server serves. No key is needed for local servers; set `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` when the endpoint requires one.

With `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` set, the Sentiment Analyst screens StockTwits and Reddit posts with TypeSafe's Jev before reading them. Posts that are not about the company are dropped, and each source opens with a count of the remaining posts by stance: bullish, bearish, neutral, or unclear. Without the key, posts pass through unscreened. `jev-latest` moves with new releases; set `TYPESAFE_DEFAULT_MODEL` to a versioned ID such as `jev-1.13.0` to hold it fixed across runs. To reach Jev through OpenRouter, put an OpenRouter key in `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and set `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api`.

Alternatively, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### CLI Usage

Launch the interactive CLI:
```bash
tradingagents          # installed command
python -m cli.main     # alternative: run directly from source
```
You will see a screen where you can select your desired tickers, analysis date, LLM provider, research depth, and more. Your previous run's answers come back as the defaults, so pressing Enter accepts them. The `TRADINGAGENTS_*` variables in `.env` still skip their step entirely.

To run without questions, for a scheduled job or a script, answer the per-run steps with flags and the rest with `TRADINGAGENTS_*` variables:
```bash
export TRADINGAGENTS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai TRADINGAGENTS_QUICK_THINK_LLM=gpt-6-luna TRADINGAGENTS_DEEP_THINK_LLM=gpt-6-sol
export TRADINGAGENTS_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE=English TRADINGAGENTS_MAX_DEBATE_ROUNDS=1 TRADINGAGENTS_MAX_RISK_ROUNDS=1
tradingagents --ticker NVDA --date 2026-09-23 --analysts market,news,fundamentals --save --no-show
```
Each flag skips only its own question. Run without a terminal, a missing answer stops the run before it starts and names the flag or variable to set.

A saved report also includes `complete_report.html`, the report as one page with its sections listed beside the text, for reading in a browser, on a phone or in print. Answering the save question at the prompt also asks about the page and can open it in your browser; `--no-html` skips it, and so does `ta.save_reports(state, "NVDA", html=False)` from Python.

### Markets and tickers

TradingAgents works with any market Yahoo Finance covers, using the exchange-suffixed ticker. Company identity and the alpha benchmark resolve automatically per market.

- US: `AAPL`, `SPY`
- Hong Kong: `0700.HK` · Tokyo: `7203.T` · London: `AZN.L`
- India: `RELIANCE.NS`, `.BO` · Canada: `.TO` · Australia: `.AX`
- China A-shares: Shanghai `.SS`, Shenzhen `.SZ` (e.g. `600519.SS` for Kweichow Moutai)
- Crypto: `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`

## TradingAgents Package

### Implementation Details

We built TradingAgents with LangGraph to ensure flexibility and modularity. The framework supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Qwen (Alibaba DashScope, international and China endpoints), GLM (Zhipu), MiniMax (global + China), OpenRouter, Ollama for local models, and Azure OpenAI for enterprise.

### Python Usage

To use TradingAgents inside your code, you can import the `tradingagents` module and initialize a `TradingAgentsGraph()` object. The `.propagate()` function will return a decision. You can run `main.py`, here's also a quick example:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# forward propagate
state, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-09-01")
print(decision)

# the same report tree the CLI saves, under results_dir/reports
ta.save_reports(state, "NVDA")
```

You can also adjust the default configuration to set your own choice of LLMs, debate rounds, etc.

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "openai"        # e.g. openai, google, anthropic, deepseek, groq, ollama; openai_compatible covers any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp, ...)
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gpt-6-sol"    # Model for complex reasoning
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-6-luna"   # Model for quick tasks
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-09-01")
print(decision)
```

The quick model serves the analysts, researchers, debaters and trader; the deep model serves the research and portfolio managers. Each can run on its own provider, for example the managers on Claude while the rest run on OpenAI:

```python
config["deep_think_provider"] = "anthropic"
config["deep_think_llm"] = "claude-opus-5-5"
```

A tier on its own provider uses that provider's key and default endpoint; set `quick_think_backend_url` or `deep_think_backend_url` for a local or relay endpoint. The `TRADINGAGENTS_DEEP_THINK_PROVIDER` and `TRADINGAGENTS_QUICK_THINK_PROVIDER` variables set them for the CLI, together with the tier's model variable.

See `tradingagents/default_config.py` for all configuration options.

### Fundamentals as filed

US company statements come from SEC EDGAR, which records the date every figure was filed. A run dated in the past reads the statements exactly as they stood that day: a fiscal year that has ended but has not been filed yet is not served, and a figure restated later still reads as first reported. Apple's 2008 total assets were filed as $39.6B and restated to $36.2B in 2010, so a run dated in between reads $39.6B. EDGAR needs no account or API key.

Other companies' statements come from Yahoo Finance, which dates a statement by the period it covers rather than by when it was published. A run dated today reads them; a run dated in the past is told they are withheld, since Yahoo cannot say which figures were public by then.

Insider trades are dated by when they happened, not when they were filed, so a run dated in the past is told they are withheld as well.

SEC asks callers to identify themselves and refuses requests that carry no contact address, so a default one is sent. Set your own so SEC can reach you rather than the project:

```bash
SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT="Your Name your@email.com"
```

It covers companies that file with the SEC, including foreign companies listed in the US. Anything else, such as Hong Kong or A-share listings, falls through to the next vendor in the chain. EDGAR's machine-readable filings begin in 2009, and a fourth quarter is reported as unavailable rather than derived, because filers publish it only inside the annual figure.

### Current holdings

By default the agents do not know what you hold, so their guidance is written for a reader who applies it to their own position. Pass a portfolio to have the trader, the risk analysts and the portfolio manager work against your actual book.

```python
from tradingagents.portfolio import PortfolioContext

portfolio = PortfolioContext.model_validate({
    "cash": 25000.0,
    "currency": "USD",
    "positions": [{"ticker": "NVDA", "quantity": 120, "average_price": 150.0}],
})
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-09-01", portfolio=portfolio)
```

The CLI takes the same content as a JSON file: `tradingagents --portfolio my_book.json`.

An empty `positions` list means a flat book, which is different from passing nothing. A run without a portfolio is never treated as flat.

## Persistence and Recovery

TradingAgents persists two kinds of state across runs.

### Memory log

The memory log is always on. Each completed run appends its decision to `~/.tradingagents/memory/trading_memory.md`. While the analysts of a later run work, TradingAgents settles every logged decision whose holding period has passed: it fetches the realised return (raw, and alpha against the instrument's regional benchmark) and generates a one-paragraph reflection. The Portfolio Manager then reads the most recent decisions for the same ticker plus recent lessons from other tickers, so each analysis carries forward what worked and what didn't. If settling fails, the run goes on and its report says so.

Override the path with `TRADINGAGENTS_MEMORY_LOG_PATH`.

To settle decisions without running an analysis, for a scheduled job, call `ta.settle_all_pending()`; it returns the decisions it settled and any it could not.

### Checkpoint resume

Checkpoint resume is opt-in via `--checkpoint`. When enabled, LangGraph saves state after each node so a crashed or interrupted run resumes from the last successful step instead of starting over. The run view says whether it resumed a saved run or started fresh. Checkpoints are cleared automatically on successful completion.

Per-ticker SQLite databases live at `~/.tradingagents/cache/checkpoints/<TICKER>.db` (override the base with `TRADINGAGENTS_CACHE_DIR`). Use `--clear-checkpoints` to reset all of them before a run.

```bash
tradingagents --checkpoint           # enable for this run
tradingagents --clear-checkpoints    # reset before running
```

```python
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["checkpoint_enabled"] = True
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-09-01")
```

## Forex and metals scanner

`tradingagents fx-scan` looks for intraday limit-order setups across seven major pairs, five crosses, gold and silver, using spot prices from OANDA. The scan itself runs no AI and costs nothing; `--agents` adds the agent review below.

```bash
tradingagents fx-scan                              # SMC strategy, 02:00–12:00 New York, RR ≥ 2
tradingagents fx-scan --agents                     # plus the agent review: up to 6 final orders
tradingagents fx-scan --symbols EURUSD,XAUUSD --min-rr 2.5
tradingagents fx-scan --strategy trend             # the original trend-pullback rules
```

### SMC strategy (default)

Every structure is detected in code from closed candles, so each level in a setup can be found on a chart. For a long (shorts mirror it):

1. **1-hour bias**: the latest break of structure on H1 is up.
2. **Sweep**: in the last six hours a 5-minute bar traded below sell-side liquidity (the previous trading day's low, the Asian or London session low, equal lows, or a swing low of the last twelve hours, the swing failure pattern) and closed back above it. A pool counts only once it has formed, and not after a bar has closed through it.
3. **Structure shift**: within three hours of the sweep, a 5-minute close breaks the last swing high (BOS or CHoCH). A shift more than two hours old is stale: the move has usually played out.
4. **Entry**: a buy limit at the middle of the unmitigated fair value gap the displacement left, preferring one inside the order block (the last down-close candle before the move), else the order block itself.
5. **Stop** beyond the sweep's wick; **target** at the nearest buy-side liquidity above price (previous day high, session high, equal highs, an intact H1 swing high) paying at least the minimum RR after the spread. Liquidity price already traded through after the shift is spent and never a target, and an entry more than two hourly ATRs from price is not offered.
6. **Window**: setups are built only between 02:00 and 12:00 New York (and Toronto) time, from the London open through the London–New York overlap (`--window 03:00-11:00` to change it; a window may cross midnight, and `--any-session` scans at any time). The window decides when to look, not how long an order lives: an unfilled order is cancelled after four hours (`--valid-hours`) or at 14:00 New York (`--latest-cancel`), whichever is first, so a fill still has three hours before the 17:00 close, and never past the Friday close. Weekends, Friday 17:00 to Sunday 17:00 New York, are always outside; outside the window the command says when it next opens and saves nothing. Trading days roll at 17:00 New York.

Each setup is scored out of 100 from the swept pool (previous day > session > equal highs/lows), displacement, FVG/order-block confluence, entry depth (discount or premium), the H1 break, reward-to-risk and freshness. The score ranks setups; it is not a win probability.

### Trend strategy

`--strategy trend` keeps the original rules: a clear 4-hour trend (price, 50 EMA and 200 EMA stacked), a pullback limit at a 1-hour swing level or the 1-hour 50 EMA within 0.3–2.5 ATR, the stop one 1-hour ATR beyond (`--stop-atr`), and the nearest intact 1-hour swing as the target.

Both strategies hold at most two trades long or short the same currency (`--max-per-currency`), need `OANDA_API_TOKEN` (a free practice account's token reads live prices), and save each scan to `<results_dir>/fx_scans/` as Markdown and JSON.

### Agent review

`tradingagents fx-scan --agents` passes the candidates to an agent team built on the same roles as the stock pipeline and picks up to six final limit orders (`--final` to change):

1. **Macro analyst** reads this week's economic calendar (high- and medium-impact releases per currency, gold and silver as USD) and the latest FXStreet headlines, and briefs the desk on each currency's driver and event risk.
2. **Price-action analyst** grades each setup's structure: the liquidity taken, the strength of the shift, the order block / FVG, discount or premium, and whether the target is realistic for the session.
3. **Bull and bear researchers** argue for and against every setup.
4. **Research manager** (deep model) decides which survive the debate, dropping setups exposed to a release before they would play out.
5. **Trader** writes the orders, keeping the scanner's levels unless the debate gives a reason to move them.
6. **Aggressive, neutral and conservative risk analysts** review the book as a whole: shared currencies, correlated pairs, orders that could fill into the same release.
7. **Portfolio manager** (deep model) chooses the final book and each order's cancel time.

The agents argue with each other rather than in isolation: the bear (Ursa) answers the bull's (Leo's) case point by point, the conservative risk analyst (Haven) answers the aggressive one (Blaze), and the neutral one (Pivot) weighs both. Each has a name, a role and a bio, shown as team cards at the foot of the dashboard: Atlas (macro), Vega (price action), Leo and Ursa (bull and bear), Sage (research manager), Nova (trader), Blaze, Haven and Pivot (risk), Ward (trade manager) and Donna (portfolio manager). Rename any of them in `~/.tradingagents/fx_team.json`, e.g. `{"macro": {"name": "Jarvis"}}`.

Every candidate gets a ticket (`#1043`) when it reaches the agents; they refer to setups by ticket, and the ticket stays with the order in the journal, the dashboard, Telegram and the reports. Rejected candidates keep theirs in the chat, so numbers in the journal can skip.

**Ward, the trade manager**, joins any review held while trades are pending or open, and under `fx-watch` also checks the live book on his own every 30 minutes (`--ward-every`, 0 to turn off) until the trades finish, inside or outside the scan window. Each of his checks is one model call and is saved as a desk-chat session. He sees each live trade's price now, its result in R so far, its best and worst, and the time left, and decides to hold, close early, tighten the stop, move the target, or withdraw a pending order. The risk team and Donna also see the live book when they size new orders. His actions are checked in code before they touch the journal: a pending order can only be held or cancelled, a stop is only ever tightened and never placed at or beyond price, and a target must stay beyond price. Every change is logged with who made it and why, shown in the journal and the chat, and sent to Telegram. Results stay in R of the original stop, and a change applies only from the moment it was made: prices are replayed up to that moment first, so a target or stop hit while the agents were deciding is recorded, and a change to a trade that has already finished is refused.

Every review is saved as a conversation: the desk's scan, each agent's message in order, the decisions and the final verification. The dashboard's **desk chat** lists the sessions and shows each one as a chat, and every journal order links to the conversation that produced it.

Every agent sees all candidates at once, so a review is ten model calls whatever the number of candidates. If the deep model fails (a spent free quota, say), the two managers fall back to the quick model before any rule-based fallback, and every failure is reported in one line.

The final orders are then checked in code against the scanner's facts: the right side of price, the minimum RR after the spread and the per-currency cap; for SMC setups an entry inside the order block / FVG, a stop beyond the sweep and a cancel time no later than the scanner's; for trend setups an entry within 1.5 ATR of the scanner's level and a stop at least 0.5 ATR away. An adjusted order that fails reverts to the scanner's levels; one that cannot be repaired is dropped with the reason. The report leads with the final orders and keeps every agent's reasoning below them.

The review uses the provider and models set in `.env` (`TRADINGAGENTS_LLM_PROVIDER` and the quick and deep models). Headlines come from FXStreet's public news feed (Yahoo Finance when it cannot be read), matched to each pair by currency, central bank and nickname. The economic calendar is the Forex Factory weekly feed, cached for an hour; it carries forecasts but not actual results, and when it cannot be read the agents are told event risk is unknown rather than absent.

### Journal, dashboard and the watcher

Every final order from `fx-scan --agents` is written to a paper-trade journal (`<results_dir>/fx_journal.db`). Nothing is sent to a broker: the journal replays OANDA's one-minute prices after each order was suggested and records what the limit order would have done.

- **Filled** when price touches the entry; **missed** if the target trades first (the move happened without the order); **expired** if the cancel time passes first.
- Once filled, **won** at the target, **lost** at the stop (a minute that touches both counts as the stop), or **closed** at the New York 17:00 close.
- Results are in R, net of the spread recorded at the scan.

```bash
tradingagents fx-journal --open      # settle, print the scorecard, open the dashboard
tradingagents fx-telegram            # set up Telegram alerts (finds your chat id, sends a test)
caffeinate -i tradingagents fx-watch --open    # run all morning
```

`fx-journal` writes `<results_dir>/fx_dashboard.html`: a self-contained page with the win rate, total and average R, profit factor, drawdown and fill rate, the cumulative-R curve, live orders, results by symbol and conviction, and every order with the agents' reasoning. It loads nothing from the network.

`fx-watch` runs one cycle every ten minutes (`--interval`). Each cycle settles the journal and reports changes; inside the window it runs the free scanner and calls the agents only when a setup appears that it has not seen earlier in the trading day, at most twelve reviews a day (`--max-agent-runs`). New orders and results go to Telegram when `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are set, and a summary is sent when the window closes. Outside the window it keeps settling open trades until the close, and the dashboard refreshes itself every minute while the watcher runs. The Mac must stay awake: `caffeinate -i` prevents idle sleep, but closing the lid still sleeps a laptop.

### Placing the orders in MetaTrader 4 (e.g. CMC Markets)

`tradingagents fx-watch --mt4` also places the desk's orders in an MT4 account and keeps them in step with the journal: new limit orders at a fixed lot size (0.01 by default), with entry, stop and target shifted half of the broker's spread so they trigger when the mid price the desk planned on reaches them, the trade manager's stop and target moves, his early closes, and cancels for orders the desk no longer waits on. Fills, closes and profit are sent to Telegram. The journal stays the desk's record, priced on OANDA; a trade filled at CMC runs on CMC's prices.

MT4 has no API on a Mac, so the watcher and the Expert Advisor `TradingAgentsBridge.mq4` exchange small files in MT4's `MQL4/Files` folder. The EA has its own limits that hold even if the watcher stops: only its own orders (magic number), never above `MaxLots`, at most `MaxOpenOrders`, instructions older than two minutes ignored, unfilled orders deleted at their cancel time and trades closed at 17:00 New York.

1. `tradingagents fx-mt4 --setup` finds MT4's folder, saves it to `~/.tradingagents/fx_mt4.json` and copies the EA into `MQL4/Experts`.
2. In MT4: open MetaEditor (F4), open `Experts/TradingAgentsBridge.mq4`, press Compile (F7), and check it says 0 errors.
3. Drag the EA from the Navigator onto any one chart, tick "Allow live trading", and turn on AutoTrading. Set the Account History tab to "Last 3 days".
4. `tradingagents fx-mt4` checks the link and lists how each symbol maps (fix one with `--symbol XAUUSD=GOLD`).
5. Run the watcher with `--mt4`. `tradingagents fx-mt4 --flatten` cancels and closes everything the desk has in MT4.

### Quinn's lab: backtesting the desk's rules

`tradingagents fx-lab` replays today's SMC scanner over past OANDA prices (12 months by default, `--months`) and grades the result against the desk's benchmarks: win rate, expectancy, profit factor, fill rate, target-before-fill, drawdown and losing streak, with a verdict on whether the rules alone show an edge. It scans every ten minutes inside the 02:00-12:00 window and applies the live rules (one order per symbol and side, the 14:00 cancel, the 17:00 close), settling each order with the journal's own simulator and a typical spread. There are no agents in the baseline: it is the bar that new rules, and the agents' filtering, must beat.

The feed shows the scanner only bars that had closed at each scan, so nothing is known before it happened. `--model asian` replays a different model, the Asian-range breakout: the first five-minute close outside the 00:00-06:00 UTC range, traded with the break as a limit order on the retest of the broken level, the stop at the range's middle and a 2R target. It works with `--anatomy` and `--experiments` too.

`--model asian-market` joins the same breakout at market within fifteen minutes of the break, instead of waiting for a retest. `--spreads cmc` replays with the spreads your MT4 bridge has recorded at the broker (see `tradingagents fx-mt4 --spreads`) instead of the typical-spread estimates.

`--timeframe m15` replays the same model a step up: the bias from the 4-hour chart and the sweep, structure shift and entry on the 15-minute chart, so stops are several times larger and the spread a smaller share of each trade. It works with `--anatomy` and `--experiments` too; the live desk still trades the 1-hour / 5-minute model.

`tradingagents fx-lab --experiments` runs Quinn's ideas, each a rule written down with the reason it should work (no orders in the London open's first two hours, only sweeps of major liquidity, nearer targets, and so on). An idea must first beat the unchanged rules on the design year (the latest twelve months) by at least 0.05R a trade, over 300+ trades, and make money; only then is it tried on the locked year before it, which no report shows. There it must make money with a profit factor of 1.1+, in three quarters out of four, with a t-score of 2 that rises by 0.1 for every ten ideas already tried there. Every try is recorded in `~/.tradingagents/lab/ledger.json`. An idea that passes is a candidate for paper trading, never a live rule by itself.

History is downloaded once into `~/.tradingagents/lab/history` and topped up on later runs; what the scanner found at every scan is cached too, so after the first run each idea takes seconds; each report is saved as Markdown, with every simulated trade as JSON, in `~/.tradingagents/lab`. A year on all fourteen instruments takes roughly half an hour.

## Evaluating decisions over time

One run gives one decision, which cannot tell you whether the system decides well. `run_backtest` runs the same pipeline over a grid of tickers and dates, writes to a memory log of its own, and scores the decisions whose holding window has since traded.

```python
from tradingagents.backtest import iter_grid, run_backtest, summarize

dates = iter_grid("2026-06-01", "2026-08-01", every_n_days=7)
result = run_backtest(["NVDA", "AAPL"], dates, config, selected_analysts=["market", "news"])
print(summarize(result).render())
```

From the CLI:

```bash
tradingagents backtest NVDA,AAPL --start 2026-06-01 --end 2026-08-01 --every 7
```

Each cell is scored on realized alpha against the instrument's regional benchmark, grouped by rating. Your own memory log is never written to, and re-running the same grid with `run_id=result.run_id` skips the cells that already ran, so an interrupted sweep continues where it stopped.

## Reproducibility

TradingAgents is LLM-driven, so two runs of the same ticker and date can differ. This is expected for a research tool built on language models, not a defect. The variation comes from a few distinct sources, and it helps to separate them.

Language model sampling is non-deterministic. Even at a fixed temperature, providers do not guarantee byte-identical output across calls, and reasoning models (the default GPT-6 family, and any thinking-mode model) vary the most because their internal reasoning is itself sampled.

Live data moves. News, StockTwits, and Reddit return different content as time passes, so a run today sees different inputs than a run last week even for the same historical trade date. Pin the analysis date to hold the price and indicator window fixed, but the social and news sources still reflect "now".

To reduce variation you can lower the sampling temperature. Set `temperature` in your config (or `TRADINGAGENTS_TEMPERATURE` in `.env`); lower values make models that honor it more repeatable. The current curated models are reasoning-first and largely ignore temperature, so for tighter reproducibility name a non-reasoning model in your config, or in `TRADINGAGENTS_DEEP_THINK_LLM` and `TRADINGAGENTS_QUICK_THINK_LLM`. Any model ID your provider serves is accepted, whether or not the picker lists it.

```python
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "openai"
config["temperature"] = 0.0
# Reasoning models ignore temperature. For tighter reproducibility, name a
# non-reasoning model in deep_think_llm / quick_think_llm.
```

What does not vary anymore: the analyzed company identity is resolved deterministically from the ticker before any agent runs, and the market analyst grounds exact price and indicator claims in a verified data snapshot. Earlier reports of "different companies" or fabricated price levels across runs are addressed by these two mechanisms.

Backtest results are not guaranteed to match any published figure. Returns depend on the model, the temperature, the date range, data quality, and the sampling above. Treat the framework as a research scaffold for studying multi-agent analysis, not as a strategy with a fixed, replicable return.
